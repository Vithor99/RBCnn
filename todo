1) convergenza migliore (piu stabile e piu utility)

    a1) model selection during testing: test model on the same set of k0 and select highest utility 
    a2) either train model with more than 100 steps or make sure that for largest k0 there is enough time to get to kss
    a3) in diagnosis test to see which policy achieves better utility

    b) salva stati
    c) target network
    d) hyperparameter search architetura modello
    e) migliorare policy gradient (PPO, DDPG, PG fatto un po meglio)
    f) fare esplorazione meglio

2) simulazioni piu high-dimensional and stochastic

3) forse cluster alfredo
